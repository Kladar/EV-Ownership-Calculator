# EV-Ownership-Calculator
**Online loan calculators are too opaque and not robust enough (not to mention loaded with ads). This make it easy to do at home.


This is a simple auto loan and cost of ownership calculator spreadsheet that fills in the rebates and tax credits for your state and calculates your monthly loan payments.  Simply fill in the orange input cells with your state, dealer, and loan options and the tables and graph will update themselves. Good for comparing rebates and interest, and getting the state infomation for buying an EV. 

You can also input your cost of electricity, how many miles a month you drive, and your insurance monthly premiums for an overall cost of ownership. 


I have grand ideas for a web based version someday. Maybe a full solar/EV workup for your home, with comparisons to UBER and Lyft use. Commodification of transportation is coming and I'd like to be ready.
